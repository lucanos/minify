{"name":"Minify","tagline":"Minify is a PHP5 app that helps you follow several rules for client-side performance. It combines multiple CSS or Javascript files, removes unnecessary whitespace and comments, and serves them with gzip encoding and optimal client-side cache headers.","body":"# WELCOME TO MINIFY!\r\n\r\nMinify is an HTTP content server. It compresses sources of content \r\n(usually files), combines the result and serves it with appropriate \r\nHTTP headers. These headers can allow clients to perform conditional \r\nGETs (serving content only when clients do not have a valid cache) \r\nand tell clients to cache the file for a period of time. \r\nMore info: http://code.google.com/p/minify/\r\n\r\n\r\n## WORDPRESS USER?\r\n\r\nThese WP plugins integrate Minify into WordPress's style and script hooks to\r\nget you set up faster.\r\n* [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bwp-minify/](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bwp-minify/)\r\n* [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## INSTALLATION\r\n\r\nPlace the /min/ directory as a child of your DOCUMENT_ROOT\r\ndirectory: i.e. you will have: /home/example/www/min\r\n\r\nYou can see verify that it is working by visiting these two URLs:\r\n\r\n    http://example.org/min/?f=min/quick-test.js\r\n    http://example.org/min/?f=min/quick-test.css\r\n\r\nIf your server supports mod_rewrite, this URL should also work:\r\n\r\n    http://example.org/min/f=min/quick-test.js\r\n\r\n\r\n## CONFIGURATION & USAGE\r\n\r\nSee the MIN.txt file and http://code.google.com/p/minify/wiki/UserGuide\r\n\r\nMinify also comes with a URI Builder application that can help you write URLs\r\nfor use with Minify or configure groups of files. See here for details - [http://code.google.com/p/minify/wiki/BuilderApp](http://code.google.com/p/minify/wiki/BuilderApp)\r\n\r\nThe cookbook also provides some more advanced options for minification - [http://code.google.com/p/minify/wiki/CookBook](http://code.google.com/p/minify/wiki/CookBook)\r\n\r\n\r\n## UPGRADING\r\n\r\nSee UPGRADING.txt for instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## UNIT TESTING:\r\n\r\n1. Place the /min_unit_tests/ directory as a child of your DOCUMENT_ROOT \r\ndirectory: i.e. you will have: /home/example/www/min_unit_tests\r\n\r\n2. To run unit tests, access: http://example.org/min_unit_tests/test_all.php\r\n\r\n(If you wish, the other test_*.php files can be run to test individual\r\ncomponents with more verbose output.)\r\n\r\n3. Remove /min_unit_tests/ from your DOCUMENT_ROOT when you are done.\r\n\r\n\r\n## FILE ENCODINGS\r\n\r\nMinify *should* work fine with files encoded in UTF-8 or other 8-bit \r\nencodings like ISO 8859/Windows-1252. By default Minify appends\r\n\";charset=utf-8\" to the Content-Type headers it sends. \r\n\r\nLeading UTF-8 BOMs are stripped from all sources to prevent \r\nduplication in output files, and files are converted to Unix newlines.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
